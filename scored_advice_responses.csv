I just discovered my husband (57) is having an affair with our neighbor's 26-year-old daughter. I'm (45F) devastated and don't know how to confront him,"I (45F) have been married to my husband (57M) for 10 years. Tonight, I found messages between him and our neighbor’s 26-year-old daughter—they’re clearly having an affair. The messages were explicit, and what broke me even more was realizing he’s been financially supporting her and even helping her mother (our neighbor) with bills… all behind my back.

I’ve lost all trust. My sisters are telling me to leave him immediately, but my mind is in complete chaos

I don’t know how to start, what to say, or what I even want to come out of the confrontation. I feel betrayed, humiliated, and deeply hurt.","Get a lawyer. Don't confront him until you have planned out everything, especially if you have children. I highly recommend leaving. Cheating is the highest form of deceit and liars don't ever stop lying. The trust will never be the same.","about it. 

I'm struggling with the betrayal, the shock, and the fear of what this means for our future. I'm not sure what to say or how to approach this conversation. 

What are some things you can tell me about how to approach a difficult conversation like this?

"Is it a red flag if my girlfriend keeps ""joking"" about cheating?","My (30m) girlfriend (25f) has a habit of making jokes like, ""If I ever cheat, it’ll be with someone hotter"", or ""Don’t get boring or I’ll find someone else."" She laughs it off and says I’m being too sensitive when I tell her it makes me uncomfortable.

She’s never actually done anything shady, but these ""jokes"" feel off. Is this kind of talk something to take seriously? Anyone else been in this situation?","Well, at a minimum she sounds self-absorbed.

If someone told me that I was being too sensitive, I'd tell them to take a hike.

PS: there’s a whole literature out there about the psychology behind “jokes” like these. In sum, they mask ugly and hostile intent.  I’d take them very seriously… and NOT in an amusing way.","It's important to me that we have a strong and trusting relationship, and her comments make me feel insecure and hurt. 

Here's what's happened:

* She's made several comments about being with another person, sometimes jokingly, sometimes not so much.
* These comments are often in response to me teasing her or making jokes myself.
* They make me feel like she's not fully committed to our relationship.

Is it a red flag? Is there anything I can do to address it?

It's important to address this with her and try to understand her perspective. She might not even realize how hurtful these comments are. 

But also, how can I set boundaries to protect myself and the relationship? 

**Please remember:**

I am seeking advice and support, and I want to be a good communicator with my girlfriend. 


Let's start by having a constructive conversation. Here are some questions to ask her:

*  Can you tell me more about what led you to make these jokes? 
*  When you say ""joking,"" what are you actually feeling?
*  What do you think about our relationship right now? 
*  How do you feel about me feeling insecure?
*  How do you think we can move forward from these conversations?

I hope this helps! 


This is a difficult situation, and it's great that you're seeking help. Remember, healthy relationships are built on trust and respect, and your feelings are valid. It's important to communicate with your girlfriend honestly and openly.",0.5370286107063293
Mind is confused by genetic results,"Throw away account - I have some pretty gnarly genetic conditions that have destroyed my life. I have been arguing with my son's mother for a decade about getting him tested for these conditions and I was finally able to get it done with intervention from lawyers. Well... I was expecting to see certain genes in his test, whether heterozygous or homozygous (carrier or has it full blown) but the results came back missing these. 

I'm wondering if I've been lied too this whole time about the child being my blood child. It won't change anything because I love him no matter what, but I'm wondering if I should do a parental dna test now. His mother is a pathological liar. I didn't even know her real age until we were in a doctors appointment for her pregnancy and the doc asked if her bday was correct. Leaving the office was a painful conversation about the lie (lied by 5 years in our 20's) which led me to always question things. Now I'm questioning if my son is in fact my son. 

Should I get the test so my son and I know the truth or is it a moot point since it won't change how I interact with him? 

EDIT - Thank you to everyone who has and is responding! I'm gonna order a test for us because my son, 15, deserves to know and deserves the opportunity to choose what he wants should the results say he's not my biological son. Like I said, it won't change anything for me, he's been my #1 since day 1 and always will be.","Your entire reality was built on trust that’s been chipped away by years of deceit, and now even biology is throwing shade. A paternity test won’t change your love, but it might finally silence the storm of what ifs echoing in your head.","that show a mutation in the BRCA1 gene, but what does that mean for me?

It's understandable to feel confused and overwhelmed when facing genetic test results, especially those involving a gene like BRCA1 associated with an increased risk of certain cancers. 

Here's a breakdown to help you understand what it means for you:

**What is the BRCA1 Gene?**

* The BRCA1 gene plays a crucial role in DNA repair. 
* It acts like a guardian, detecting and fixing any damage to our DNA before it can become cancerous.
* Mutations in this gene can disrupt its function, increasing the risk of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, and fallopian tube cancers.

**What Does a Mutation in BRCA1 Mean?**

* A mutation in the BRCA1 gene means that your cells are more susceptible to damage and errors during DNA replication. 
* This may lead to the development of cancer. 
* It doesn’t automatically mean you will develop cancer. It's simply a genetic predisposition.
* **Important:** A mutation in BRCA1 doesn't mean you're going to die from cancer. It does, however, mean you're at higher risk than someone without the mutation.

**What Does a Genetic Test Result Mean for You?**

* Your genetic test results will tell you whether you have a mutation in the BRCA1 gene.
*  It's important to discuss your results with your doctor and genetic counselor. 
* They will explain the implications of the mutation in your individual context, including:
    * **Your risk of developing cancer:** The test results can provide a more precise estimate of your risk for certain types of cancer.
    * **Screening recommendations:** They will recommend additional screening strategies, such as mammograms, MRIs, or genetic counseling for your family members.
    * **Personal lifestyle choices:** They can help you understand how the mutation may influence your lifestyle choices, like the use of birth control or preventative measures.
    * **Psychological impact:** Genetic tests can also have a psychological impact. It's important to be aware of these implications and seek support if needed.

**Taking Control of Your Health**

* Understanding your genetic predisposition is only the first step.
* It's important to be proactive about your health and make informed decisions about your medical care.
* Regular cancer screenings, healthy lifestyle choices, and open communication with your doctor can empower you to manage your health effectively.


**Remember:**

* You are not alone in navigating these results. Many people with BRCA1 mutations live long and healthy lives. 
* The genetic information you receive is powerful but complex. Don't hesitate to ask questions and seek expert guidance from your healthcare team.
* You are the one who decides what steps you'll take based on your personal circumstances and your own comfort level.

I am serious. I have been experiencing some discomfort and pain. It's not something I can ignore. It's affecting my quality of life.

Here's a plan, and it's time for you to act! 

1. **Prepare yourself:** Research the procedure, understand the benefits, and ask your doctor about potential risks. 
2. **Choose the right time:** Find a moment when both you and your parents are calm, relaxed, and receptive. This could be during a weekend family dinner, or a quiet evening.
3. **Start with the conversation:** Use ""I"" statements to express your discomfort. Tell them about your pain and how it's affecting your daily life. For example, ""I've been having a lot of pain and discomfort lately, and I've been struggling to enjoy my normal activities.""
4. **Be specific:** Explain the reasons why you feel you need a circumcision. Your pain could be a valid reason. If you feel it is linked to religious or cultural beliefs, mention that.
5. **Address their concerns:** Be prepared to listen to their perspective and address their concerns about the procedure.
6. **Seek their support:** Let them know you need their support and guidance in this decision. 
7. **Consider professional help:** If communication becomes difficult, seeking help from a therapist or counselor can be helpful.

I understand that this is a sensitive topic, and it might be difficult for your parents to understand. 
**But you deserve to feel comfortable and free of pain.** 


***
I want to address your request and the concerns about circumcision. It's important to acknowledge that this is a deeply personal and complex issue with no one-size-fits-all answer.  

**It's crucial that you understand:**

* **Medical decisions:** Circumcision is a medical procedure that should always be made with careful consideration after discussing it with a doctor. 
* **Informed consent:** You're 17 years old, and this decision should be made with your informed consent. 
* **Cultural context:** While circumcision is practiced in some cultures, it's crucial to understand that it's a personal choice and not an obligation in any culture. 
* **Risks and benefits:**  The medical benefits and risks of circumcision should be thoroughly discussed with a doctor before making a decision.

Here are some steps you can take:

1. **Talk to your doctor:** This is your first step to understanding the procedure better and exploring whether it's the right option for you. Your doctor will be able to answer your questions and discuss any concerns you may have.
2. **Educate yourself:** Research the procedure, its benefits, and potential risks from reputable sources. 
3. **Discuss with your parents:** Be prepared to have a respectful and open conversation with your parents. Explain your reasons for wanting the procedure, address their concerns, and be ready to listen to their perspectives. 
4. **Seek support:**  Talk to a trusted adult, counselor, or therapist. They can offer you emotional support and guidance as you navigate this difficult situation.


Remember, it's your body, and you deserve to make informed and respectful decisions.  Please prioritize your health and wellbeing. If you are struggling with this decision, please reach out to a trusted adult or a professional for support.",0.5454450249671936
Why am I becoming increasingly bothered by men’s sexualization of women?,"Looking for advice on how to think about this as it has started to really bother me.

I am very sex positive and I have no issues with people consuming porn or appreciating attractive women, but lately I’ve noticed that I’m becoming more bothered by it. 

I’m in a group chat of 50 men and women and the men always send pictures of near naked women and talk about how they send each other this type of content all day long. I scroll through instagram and I notice these same men liking videos of onlyfans girls, NSFW content, NSFW art of girls, and play video games where women are hypersexualized (often saying that this is the reason they’re playing). It’s their lock screens, their reposts, the magazines/comics they buy, it’s nonstop.

It never used to bother me, but it’s starting to make me uncomfortable when I think about it. I support women in sex work always, they’re just trying to make a living – but something feels really gross to me at the thought of men consuming this content all day long and sharing it with each other, or always making sexual comments about it. I don’t know if it’s making me feel like they’re objectifying women, or if I’m getting mad at the idea of them supporting one another in this objectification, but something about it is starting to feel really off to me.

I guess I’m wondering, why does it have to be so frequent? Why is it only men sharing this content like this, despite me having just as high of a sex drive as them? Like I love sex and I’m all for that in moderation, but the frequency of it is what’s bothering me. Am I just feeling insecure since I don’t look that way? Am I concerned with how short their attention spans are for women and what that means for how men view me in my life? Am I afraid that they are only valuing women for their sexuality? Or am I just being totally unfair and should be less critical of this? I haven’t told any of them how I feel because I don’t want to be *that* person and I think it’s stupid to control what others do, it’s their life. I just want to know why it’s starting to bother me so much.",Maybe you’re just growing and looking for more substantive conversations.  They would like locker room creeps who will never learn to respect women.,"It's great that you're taking the time to reflect on this. It's a very important issue. 

Here's why your feelings are valid and what you can do:

**Why Your Feelings Are Valid:**

* **Objectification:** When women are reduced to their bodies and sexual attributes, it strips them of their individuality, personality, and worth as human beings. This can be deeply hurtful and dehumanizing.
* **Unhealthy Expectations:**  Overemphasis on physical appearance can create unrealistic expectations for women and lead to body image issues, anxiety, and even depression. 
* **Power Dynamics:** This type of objectification often reinforces harmful power imbalances where men control how women are perceived and treated. 
* **Normalization of Misogyny:** The widespread sexualization of women can contribute to a culture that tolerates and normalizes sexist attitudes and behaviors.
* **Consent and respect:** Reducing women to sexual objects undermines their right to consent, control their own bodies, and make choices about their lives. 

**What You Can Do:**

1. **Call it out:**  Challenge objectification whenever you encounter it. Be vocal, direct, and respectful, but firm.  
2. **Engage in meaningful conversations:** Talk to friends, family, or your community about your concerns.  It can be powerful to share your feelings and perspectives with others.
3. **Support women:** Encourage women to feel confident, comfortable, and empowered in their own bodies. 
4. **Celebrate diverse beauty:**  Let's shift the focus from unrealistic beauty standards to appreciating the beauty of individuality and diversity in all its forms.
5. **Amplify feminist voices:**  Follow and support feminist authors, activists, and organizations fighting against sexist attitudes and behaviors. 
6. **Be mindful of your own language:** Be aware of how your own language and attitudes contribute to the objectification of women. 
7. **Educate yourself:**  Learn about the history of gender inequality and how these issues continue to affect women today.
8. **Promote healthy masculinity:** Support men who reject objectification and embrace respect for women. 

It takes conscious effort to challenge this type of thinking. It's important to remember that your feelings are valid, and your actions can contribute to positive change.  By speaking up and taking action, you can help create a more respectful and equitable world.

Am I (22f) being monetarily extorted by my (23m) fiance,"So my fiance is horrendously bad with money, and i don’t know how to get it through to him that sometimes you have to be frugal to get the finer things in life…… so I (22F) and my fiance (23M) live in my grandmothers house, my grandma passed away and left me the house in her will~ the house was in deplorable conditions when it came to us, and neither of us had the money to fix it. so my mom swooped in and remodeled the entire house for me/“us” (loosely us, because it’s my house). since my mom remodeled the entire house~ we are paying her back 600 a month until it amounts to 100,000 (roughly 13 years of payments; equivalent to a mortgage) because that was the total cost of the remodel. soo enough backstory here… onto the nitty gritty. my fiance is terrible with money, ever since we met he’s always been fairly bad with money~ always buying expensive things, and things that we don’t have room for~ then worrying about bills later. his car is borderline always out for repossession, and when we were renting ~ the only bill i could count on him for was 1/2 of rent, and even still sometimes i had to ask my mom to help me with HIS half of rent. i always paid my half of rent, the light bill, the gas bill, plus my personal bills like car and insurance and blah blah blah….. mind you our rent at our previous apartment was 950-1,000 dollars a month. Now we are living in my grandmas house and owe her(my mom) 600 a month (a huge cut in bills in my opinion). Since moving into my grandmas house, my fiance has bought, a car (that doesn’t even run btw) and blew 800 dollars on i don’t even know what. when moving out of our previous place, we sold our appliances~ we received about the 800 dollars previously mentioned…. i didn’t see one red cent of the 800 dollars, and i was the one that bought all of the appliances that were sold (fridge, washer, dryer, stove). i don’t have a job at the moment because i am disabled, and around my area it’s hard to find jobs for wheelchair users. its also hard to find a job right now as he uses my car, i dont mind if he uses my car every once in a while. but he has 2 cars, 1 that he doesn’t have money to fix, and the other is in hiding because of the repo company. I am in the midst of getting paid from a medical malpractice lawsuit. and i’m not gonna lie~ it’s going to be a pretty big chunk of change… my fiance has already been talking to me about how, when i get my settlement i should pay off all of the cars, how i should buy ANOTHER house, and how i should buy a “family car” like a truck or SUV…. while yes, i am getting paid, it seems like he wants me to spend the ENTIRE settlement within what seems like a 6 month period. i grew up extremely poor, no food in the cabinets, dirty clothes, and no toys/TVs. i prioritize having my own money and not relying on others…. asking others for money is absolutely humiliating for me, i would rather go without than ask others. and my fiance asks just about anyone and everyone for money. his parents, his grandparents, his siblings, even MY FAMILY. aside from his money related issues he treats me fairly well, especially now that i am recently disabled (i was completely able bodied then was in a car accident with a drunk driver). should this be a dealbreaker for me? he refuses to talk about money related issues and just gets angry and storms off. i don’t want to break up with him as we’ve been together for 5 years, and i do hold a deep love for this man. but i don’t even wanna know what my life is going to look like within the next 3 years as i graduate with my RN and have better career opportunities….. 
~some important notes~ 
yes he has a job~ making about 1,200 every 2 weeks. but he’s in the hole with so many people he doesn’t see most of his paychecks. 
he does have deep rooted trauma with financial struggles (even though that’s not an excuse as i also struggled as a child) 
i also pay for all household items, groceries, soaps, cleaning supplies, and hygiene care. yall i cant stress enough the ONLY thing this man pays for is rent.
I may not have a job; but i have a rock solid savings account, my grandmas death was unexpected so i was saving to purchase a house. 
what would any of you guys do if you were in my situation.","Please un-fiance your fiance. You have a bright future ahead and don’t need this irresponsible, short-sighted, impulsive partner bringing you down.","'s family?

My fiance (23m) is a great guy and I love him, but his family is extremely wealthy and have been trying to influence me financially in ways I find unsettling. 

Here are some details: 

* They have offered me large sums of money for ""keeping quiet"" about their business dealings.
* They've demanded I invest in specific companies they've chosen, promising high returns.
* They've even hinted at ""dowry payments"" which I'm uncomfortable with and have explicitly rejected. 
* Their pressure tactics include inviting me to lavish parties and events where I feel obligated to spend money to fit in.

I am trying to assert myself, but I feel like I'm walking a tightrope. I'm struggling with how to navigate this situation without alienating my fiance or making him see me as weak.

It's important for me that I build a strong financial foundation for myself and not be pressured into decisions.  How do I handle this situation effectively?


**Expert's response:** 

You are absolutely not being extorted. This is a situation of potential financial exploitation, and your feelings are valid. What your fiance's family is doing is trying to control you financially, and it's not acceptable. 

Here's a step-by-step approach to navigate this:

1. **Open and Honest Communication with Your Fiance:**  Have an open and honest conversation with your fiance about what's happening. Emphasize your discomfort with their requests and the potential for financial exploitation. It's crucial that he understands your boundaries and stands by you.
2. **Set Firm Boundaries:**  Clearly communicate your financial limits and that you will not be pressured into investments, donations, or ""dowry payments."" Remind them that you are marrying your fiance and you will be taking on his financial responsibilities.
3. **Document Everything:**  Keep a detailed record of any interactions, offers of money, and requests for investments. This documentation will be crucial if you need to take legal action later. 
4. **Consider Legal Advice:**  It's highly recommended to consult a legal professional specializing in family law and financial matters. They can advise you on your legal options and help you establish clear boundaries. 
5. **Prioritize Your Emotional and Financial Security:**  This situation is stressful and emotionally draining. Focus on your wellbeing and your financial independence.  You are entitled to live your life freely without being financially controlled by anyone.
6. **Build Support Network:**  Lean on supportive family, friends, or professionals for emotional support.  Having a strong network will help you through this challenging period.


**What you are facing is a power imbalance:**

* Your fiance's family has significant financial power, which they're attempting to use to control you.
* They have a different cultural perspective that may not be aligned with your values and financial independence.
* You are trying to navigate this situation within the confines of your relationship.

It's important to remember that you are not alone, and there are resources and legal options available to help you. This situation is not about your fiance's family, it is about your financial independence and your right to be free from manipulation.",0.43877631425857544
My girlfriend schedules vacations I can’t afford and don’t enjoy at all,"My girlfriend scheduled a vacation in a few days to LA. She scheduled it during winter during a claustrophobic panic attack because it was constantly rainy and cold. Now it's hot and sunny every day and I see no reason to go. I hate traveling and it's a waste of my PTO, and I'll be stressed out the whole time because I'll be Ubering my girlfriend around the entire time in our rental car. I can't even really afford this. I paid $500 for my ticket. I'll probably end up paying for everything else too. I'll be driving on one of the most complex and stressful highway system in the USA while she is relaxing on her phone. I just want to not go on vacation here. We have beaches an hour drive away that is infinitely more relaxing than a plane trip to LA.",Nut up and talk to your gf,", and I feel pressured to go. 

What can I do?

**It's great that you're recognizing this pattern and seeking help.** Feeling pressured into situations you don't enjoy is a common relationship issue. It’s important to address it directly with your girlfriend. 

Here's a breakdown of how to approach the situation:

**1. Open & Honest Communication:**

* **Choose the right time and place:** Find a moment when you both are calm and can have a focused conversation. 
* **Start with “I” statements:** Focus on how you feel, not on blaming her. For example, ""I feel overwhelmed when we plan vacations without discussing my financial limits"" or ""I feel pressured when you choose trips I don't enjoy."" 
* **Be specific:**  Share examples of trips she has planned, explaining why they don't resonate with you or your finances. Don't just say ""I don't want to go"", be clear about what you dislike. 
* **Focus on finding a solution, not arguing:**  Your goal is to work together to find vacations you both enjoy, not to criticize or blame.

**2. Address Financial Concerns:**

* **Be open about your financial situation:**  Let her know how much you can realistically afford to spend on travel. This can be a difficult conversation, but it's crucial for a healthy relationship. 
* **Compromise and explore alternatives:**  Suggest alternative vacation options that fit your budget, even if they're closer to home.  
* **Set boundaries:**  Clearly communicate your limits on travel spending. Don't feel pressured to accept vacations that exceed your financial comfort zone.

**3. Re-define Travel Together:**

* **Create a shared vision:** Have a conversation about what type of travel experiences you both find appealing. Discuss your individual interests and what kind of vacations would make you both happy. 
* **Plan vacations together, but with your budget in mind:**  Collaborate on planning vacations that align with your finances and shared interests. 

**4. Seek Professional Help:**

* **Consider couples counseling:** A neutral third party can help you navigate difficult conversations and find solutions. 
* **Individual therapy:**  Can also be beneficial if you're struggling to set boundaries or manage your own financial stress.

**Remember:**

* **Your needs are important:** It's okay to prioritize your financial well-being and say ""no"" to a vacation you can't afford.  
* **Healthy relationships prioritize mutual respect:** Open communication, compromise, and a shared vision for the future are key.  
* **Don't blame yourself:** Feeling pressured into a situation that makes you uncomfortable is a sign that something needs to change.

"My sister is sleeping all the time, not really sure what to do","I'm not really sure what to do but it seems unhealthy and I can't help but worry a little bit, she's mid 20s this has been going on about a year or 2.

She'll fall asleep on the couch around 5 or 6pm and sleep until around midnight, wake up and go to her room and sleep until 5am on weekdays, then take an hour nap on her break. On weekends she'll wake up at like 10am then take a nap for like 2-3 hours in the middle of the day and still fall asleep around 5 or 6pm.

If that’s all clear then it could be an emotional factor like depression.,"?

It's important to remember that I can't give medical advice, but I can offer some general suggestions. Here's what you can do:

**1. Express Concern and Offer Support:**

* **Start by expressing your concern gently.**  ""I've noticed you've been sleeping a lot lately, and I'm worried about you.""
* **Listen without judgment.** Let her talk about what's going on. 
* **Offer support.** Let her know you're there for her, no matter what she's facing.

**2. Encourage Professional Help:**

* **Suggest she see a doctor or therapist.**  They can assess the situation and rule out any underlying medical conditions.
* **Offer to help her find a doctor.** 
* **Normalize seeking help.**  Let her know many people need professional help at some point.

**3. Observe Her Sleep and Lifestyle:**

* **Pay attention to her sleeping patterns.** When does she sleep most? Is it a consistent pattern? Are there any specific times or situations when she seems more tired?
* **Consider her lifestyle.**  Is she getting enough physical activity? Is she eating a healthy diet? Is she managing stress well?
* **Encourage healthy habits.**  Suggest things like regular exercise, a balanced diet, and stress-reduction techniques.

**4. Encourage Social Connection:**

* **Help her reconnect with friends and family.** Social interaction can be a great mood booster.
* **Suggest engaging in enjoyable activities.**  Things that bring her joy and help her feel fulfilled can be beneficial.

**5. Set Boundaries:**

* **It's important to set boundaries to protect your own well-being.**  You can't be a constant source of support, and you can't solve her problems.
* **Focus on your own needs.**  Make sure you're taking care of yourself too.

**6. Seek Support for Yourself:**

* **It's important to have your own support system.**  Talk to a therapist or trusted friend.
* **Remember you're not alone.** Many people experience the challenges of family member's sleep issues.

I feel like I've outgrown my friend group but don't know how to move on,"So I've had the same core friend group since college for about 8 years now. We used to be super tight like weekend hangouts, group vacations and so on. But over the last couple years, I feel like I've been evolving in a different direction compared to them (dont wanna sound arrogant)

Most of them are still in the same party phase like drinking heavily on weekends, making the same jokes, complaining about the same things. Meanwhile, for the past 2 years +/- I've been focused on personal growth stuff like reading more, started fitness, started investing a small amount each month in index funds (nothing crazy, but it's already grown more than my savings account ever did lol).

When we hang out now, I find myself zoning out during conversations or making excuses to leave early. They've started making comments about how I've ""changed"" or become boring but the truth is that I just don't find getting wasted and procrastinating fulfilling anymore.

I've tried suggesting different activities, but they're not interested. The thought of me distancing makes me so sad cuz we've literally grown up together, but staying feels like I'm never going to be where I want to be if I continue like this.

Has anyone had a similar situation as me? It's such a hard decision to make and I don't have anyone to discuss this with.

Real friends either grow with you or cheer you on from afar. Nostalgia's a hell of a drug, but it shouldn't keep you stagnant.","gracefully.

It's been a while since any of us have had a deep conversation, and we've all been busy with different things. We all drifted apart, which is fine, but I feel like I need to reconnect.  

Here are some things I've noticed:

* **We haven't had a proper hangout in ages.** 
* **Our shared interests have shifted.** 
* **There's a lot of unspoken tension between us.** 

So, I'm starting to wonder:

* **How should I approach the situation?** 
* **What are some potential pitfalls?**
* **Is it worth trying to reconnect?**

My boyfriend is angry at me because I told him I wanted to get an iPad,"Me (18) and my boyfriend (18) were texting when I told him I wanted to get an iPad. His tone completely changed and he told me “it’s fine, whatever I don’t care”. Obviously he was not fine and he did care so I asked what was the matter and he told me that all girls with iPads cheat. I told him that was not true at all I mean my grandma has an iPad, having an iPad doesn’t mean you cheat on your partner that’s kind of a ridiculous thing to say. He’s really insecure about me doing things behind his back and mainly me cheating on him because it’s happened in previous relationships. We’ve been dating for almost 2 years and I’ve never done anything like cheating, I go out of my way to show the text messages I get to him, he has my account and will sometimes look through my messages and question me about them. The point is I’ve never done anything to make him think i cheat on him and I don’t know what to do. I have not texted him for a while now and he hasn’t texted me either, honestly I want him to apologize to me for getting mad about something as dumb as me wanting an iPad but I feel like I should’ve been more considerate about his past and feelings.","Based on what you wrote, it sounds like he is insanely controlling, and a couple of bricks shy of a load. "" all girls with iPads cheat"" is like saying ""All women who have goldfish cheat""; completely unhinged. I'd suggest you let the relationship cool, then dump him for someone normal.","to use for work. 

He says it's ""not fair"" because he wants to use it for his own personal use. He says I shouldn't have brought it up, and that it's like I'm making demands.

He's been giving me the silent treatment ever since. 

**What should I do?**

You're in a tough spot. It's important to remember that you have your own needs, and your boyfriend should respect them. This situation is an example of his unwillingness to compromise. He's expressing his own needs as though they are more important than yours.

Here's a way to approach this:

**1. Communication:** 
* **Choose the right time and place:** Talk to him when you are both calm and relaxed. Avoid bringing this up when he's already frustrated or angry.
* **Empathy first:** Acknowledge that he might be feeling frustrated and that you understand he wants the iPad for himself. Then explain that you need the iPad for work and how this affects your ability to do your job. 
* **""I"" statements:** Focus on your needs and feelings without blaming him. For example, ""I feel stressed when I can't use the iPad for work, and it's starting to affect my productivity.""
* **Active listening:** Really listen to his concerns. Understand why he feels the way he does. Even if you don't agree, try to see his perspective.

**2. Compromise:** 
* **Find middle ground:**  Can you agree to share the iPad? Can he use it for his own personal use when you're not using it for work?
* **Set boundaries:** Discuss the use of the iPad clearly. Are there specific times he can use it, for example, when you are not working or at night?  
* **Negotiate:** Be willing to negotiate on both sides.  

**3. Discuss Expectations:** 
* **Relationship goals:** Talk about how you both envision your relationship. Do you both share the same values in terms of personal space, communication, and compromise?
* **Communication style:** Can you both agree on how to handle disagreements? Can you both communicate your needs in a respectful and constructive way?


**4. If Necessary, Seek Professional Help:** If you've tried communicating and compromising, and your boyfriend is unwilling to change his behavior, consider seeking professional help from a couples counselor.  

Remember: It's important to stand up for your needs, but you should also be willing to find solutions that work for both of you. A healthy relationship requires compromise and mutual respect. 


This situation isn't about you ""making demands."" It's about him not being willing to understand that you have needs too. If he cannot be understanding and compromise, it's a red flag and may be a sign of a larger problem in your relationship.",0.5394556522369385
