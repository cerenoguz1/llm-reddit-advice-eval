{"text":"<start_of_prompt>Boundaries between friends?<end_of_prompt><start_of_response>If you were comfortable with her level of boundaryless-ness it could potentially be fine and healthy and not really change anything bc it is normal for intimacy to increase as trust increases. THAT BEING SAID, it sounds like you are not comfortable with this level of intimacy or that at the very least it feels confusing and concerning. Your experience matters. I would recommend either privately setting boundaries like not hanging out with her while y\u2019all are intoxicated, or not going to her house\u2026 for some examples. OR, if you have confusion that you want to sort out, you can have a convo with her where you make your observations known and ask questions or make requests. Example: I\u2019ve noticed a trend of intimacy shifting. I\u2019m wondering what type of friendship you are wanting. I want a slightly less intimate friendship because that\u2019s what I\u2019m most comfortable with. Do you think you are willing to stay dressed in my presence? I don\u2019t want to shame you or anything, it\u2019s just my cultural preference. OR, for example, if you think she wants to be really close and you also want to be really close, you can just have a more explicit conversation so that you all agree on the expectations and consent agreements basically. Like maybe you want to ask her if she is interested in having a more physical relationship. I will warn you that without knowing more about your friendship or what she is like, I have no idea how much honesty the friendship can tolerate. Trust your instincts on the appropriate level of confrontation and hope for the best. If she is being covertly manipulative or can\u2019t actually handle a healthy relationship with a lot of intimacy, she might react negatively to a relaxed open convo about consent and boundaries\u2026 so while it may not be ideal if the friendship is injured by an open convo, it will still ultimately be for the best because you won\u2019t be continuously nurturing an unhealthy relationship<end_of_response>"}

Give her a space to open up to you about it and take whatever she says on the chin. Then talk about what you can do to rebuild that comfortability. \n\nI'd say to return to your relationship being monogamous between one another while you work through this situation.

First let me say its 100% okay if you and others don't like the art.  That is totally your prerogative.  However, there is an entire subsection of anime and related art that literally is based on what you just described.  Young men and women (or boys and girls) wearing clothing or using equipment that is definitely questionable.\n\nSo you approach it honestly.  Let your friend know you aren't comfortable with that art and would rather not see it.  That's it.  Conversation over.\n\nIf your friend asks, \"why\", just tell them you feel it sexualizes a child-like figure and that makes you uncomfortable.  Notice in none of that are you BLAMING your friend, you are merely describing YOUR experience of the art.<end_of_response>"}

{"text":"<start_of_prompt>How can I learn reading the analogue clock?<end_of_prompt><start_of_response>Practice. Google some pictures and practice figuring out the time, or even better get an actual analog clock (or if you have a smartwatch change the watch face to analog).\n\n\nI assume you know the theory, but since you mentioned mixing up the hour, just remember that the short\/hour hand always points exactly to or past the hour it is. So if the short hand is between 12 and 1, it\u2019s some time in the 12 o\u2019clock hour. It should be easier to remember if you know why: as the minute hand winds around the clock, the hour hand does too in a slower circle, as opposed to jumping from number to number. So at 12:00 both hands point to 12 exactly and as the hour progresses, both hands make their way around the clock, with the minute hand going all the way back to 12 and the hour hand only making it to 1 by 1:00. Sorry if you already know all that, I figured I would explain it just in case you\u2019ve been trying to just memorize the look of each time, which is much harder<end_of_response>"}

In matters of connection, its often less a matter of \"right and wrong\" and more a matter of \"effective and ineffective.\" \n\nIf you believe these relationships are salvageable, perhaps asking them directly what is going on and what it might take to make repairs will shed light on if you care enough to fix it.<end_of_response>"}
